Notes to the ML-Agents runs.

## PPO 67
* Should be same as PPO 66 / 65.
* Rerun of known configuration due to a Unity and or code problem.
* Issue was most likely due to a endless loop in the reposition code of the agent.

## PPO 68
* Random position of the agent.
* Otherwise no change compared to PPO 68.
